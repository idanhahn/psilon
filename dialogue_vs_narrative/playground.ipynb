      "The woman was attractive, in her mid-thirties, wearing gray, pleated flannel pants, conservative flats, and an ivory Laura Ashley blouse.\n",
      "The woman’s hair was light brown and fashioned in Washington’s most popular style – the ‘anchorwoman’ – a lush feathering, curled under at the shoulders .\n",
      "‘I’m a little late,’ the woman said, her voice unassuming.\n",
      "‘I have a breakfast meeting with Senator Sexton.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The maitre d’ felt an unexpected tingle of nerves.\n",
      "Lately Sexton’s face seemed to be on every national magazine, his campaign slogan plastered all across America: ‘Stop spending.\n",

      "‘Busy.\n",
      "I see your campaign’s going well.’\n",

      "Rachel exhaled, already fighting the urge to check her watch.\n",

      "‘Some prominent divorcé looking for a young wife?’\n",

      "‘My pleasure, Ralph.\n",
      "‘Of course, sir.’ He pulled out a minirecorder and turned it on.\n",
      "‘Senator, your television ads call for legislation ensuring equal salaries for women in the workplace .\n",
      "Can you comment on your rationale?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sure.\n",
      "‘And on the subject of families,’ the reporter followed up, ‘you talk a lot about education.\n",
      "You’ve proposed some highly controversial budget cuts in an effort to allocate more funds to our nation’s schools.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I believe the children are our future.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel could not believe her father had sunk to quoting pop songs.\n",
      "‘Finally, sir,’ the reporter said, ‘you’ve taken an enormous jump in the polls these past few weeks.\n",
      "Any thoughts on your recent success?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think it has to do with trust.\n",
      "‘Your daughter is obviously a busy woman.\n",
      "It’s refreshing to see you two still find time in your schedules to dine together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As I said, family comes first.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sneeden nodded, and then his gaze hardened.\n",
      "‘Might I ask, sir, how you and your daughter manage your conflicts of interest?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Conflicts?’ Senator Sexton cocked his head with an innocent look of confusion.\n",
      "‘What conflicts do you mean?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel glanced up, grimacing at her father’s act.\n",
      "‘Well, sir . . .’ The reporter coughed, feigning uneasiness over the question.\n",
      "‘The conflict is that your daughter works for your opponent.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Sexton exploded in laughter, defusing the question instantly.\n",
      "‘Ralph, first of all, the President and I are not opponents.\n",
      "‘And second?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Second, my daughter is not employed by the President; she is employed by the intelligence community.\n",
      "‘In fact, dear, I’m not sure you’ve even met the President, have you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel stared, her eyes smoldering.\n",
      "‘Gentlemen,’ she said.\n",
      "‘It breaks my heart, but I have to go.\n",
      "I’m late for work.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ms Sexton,’ the reporter said quickly, ‘before you go, I was wondering if you could comment on the rumors that you called this breakfast meeting to discuss the possibility of leaving your current post to work for your father’s campaign?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel felt like someone had thrown hot coffee in her face.\n",
      "‘Miss Sexton?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel locked eyes with the reporter.\n",
      "‘Ralph, or whoever the hell you are, get this straight: I have no intention of abandoning my job to work for Senator Sexton, and if you print anything to the contrary, you’ll need a shoehorn to get that recorder out of your ass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The reporter’s eyes widened.\n",
      "‘Thank you both.’ He disappeared.\n",
      "‘You’d do well to learn some poise.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel began collecting her things.\n",
      "‘This meeting is over.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The senator was apparently done with her anyway.\n",
      "‘’Bye, sweetie.\n",
      "You’re thirty-three years old.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thirty-four,’ she snapped.\n",
      "‘Your secretary sent a card.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He clucked ruefully.\n",
      "‘Thirty-four.\n",
      "You know by the time I was thirty-four, I’d already—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Married Mom and screwed the neighbor?’ The words came out louder than Rachel had intended, her voice hanging naked in an ill-timed lull.\n",
      "‘You watch yourself, young lady.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel headed for the door.\n",
      "‘Time for a flyby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men nodded.\n",
      "‘Good morning, Ms Sexton.’ The guard smiled as she approached the steel doorway.\n",
      "‘You know the drill,’ he said.\n",
      "‘Looks like you’re still you.’ He pulled the used swab from the machine and dropped it through an opening, where it was instantly incinerated.\n",
      "‘Have a good one.’ He pressed a button and the huge steel doors swung open.\n",
      "Rachel worked here as a ‘gister.’ Gisting, or data reduction, required analyzing complex reports and distilling their essence or ‘gist’ into concise, single-page briefs.\n",
      "In NRO-speak, Rachel Sexton ‘manufactured finished product and serviced the customer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the job was difficult and required long hours, the position was a badge of honor for her, a way to assert her independence from her father.\n",
      "The man’s quiet diligence, combined with his wardrobe of plain black suits, had earned him the nickname the ‘Quaker.’ A brilliant strategist and the model of efficiency, the Quaker ran his world with an unrivaled clarity.\n",
      "His mantra: ‘Find the truth.\n",
      "‘Agent Sexton, have a seat.’ His voice had a lucid rawness to it.\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir.’ Rachel sat.\n",
      "‘Agent Sexton, the President called me about a half hour ago.\n",

      "‘On the contrary.\n",
      "‘So what did he want?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A meeting with you.\n",
      "‘A personal meeting?\n",
      "About what?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Damn good question.\n",
      "‘He asked that I contact you immediately and send you to meet with him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Right now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He sent transportation.\n",
      "‘You obviously have reservations.’\n",

      "‘I sure as hell do!’ Pickering showed a rare flash of emotion.\n",
      "‘The President’s timing seems almost callow in its transparency.\n",
      "‘Do you not trust the President’s motives?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My oath is to provide intel support to the current White House administration, not pass judgment on their politics.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical Pickering response, Rachel realized.\n",
      "William Pickering made no bones about his view of politicians as transitory figureheads who passed fleetingly across a chessboard whose real players were men like Pickering himself – seasoned ‘lifers’ who had been around long enough to understand the game with some perspective.\n",
      "‘Maybe it’s an innocent request,’ Rachel offered, hoping the President was above trying some sort of cheap campaign stunt.\n",
      "‘Maybe he needs a reduction of some sensitive data.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not to sound belittling, Agent Sexton, but the White House has access to plenty of qualified gisting personnel if they need it.\n",
      "‘Your father is gaining political momentum,’ Pickering said.\n",
      "‘A lot of it.\n",
      "‘Politics is a desperate business.\n",
      "‘And you’re afraid the White House feels desperate enough to introduce me into the political mix?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Pickering paused a moment.\n",
      "‘You are not exactly silent about your feelings for your father, and I have little doubt the President’s campaign staff is aware of the rift.\n",
      "It occurs to me that they may want to use you against him somehow.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where do I sign up?’ Rachel said, only half joking.\n",
      "‘A word of warning, Agent Sexton.\n",
      "If you feel that your personal issues with your father are going to cloud your judgment in dealing with the President, I strongly advise that you decline the President’s request for a meeting.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Decline?’ Rachel gave a nervous chuckle.\n",
      "‘I obviously can’t refuse the President.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ the director said, ‘but I can.’\n",
      "\n",
      "His words rumbled a bit, reminding Rachel of the other reason Pickering was called the ‘Quaker.’ Despite being a small man, William Pickering could cause political earthquakes if he were crossed.\n",
      "‘My concerns here are simple,’ Pickering said.\n",
      "‘I have a responsibility to protect the people who work for me, and I don’t appreciate even the vague implication that one of them might be used as a pawn in a political game.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you recommend I do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Pickering sighed.\n",
      "‘My suggestion is that you meet with him.\n",
      "If I think he’s playing political hardball with you, trust me, I’ll pull you out so fast the man won’t know what hit him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir.’ Rachel sensed a protective aura from the director that she often longed for in her own father.\n",
      "‘And you said the President already sent a car?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not exactly.’ Pickering frowned and pointed out the window.\n",
      "‘The White House sent a PaveHawk to take me fifteen miles into D.C.?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Apparently the President hopes you are either impressed or intimidated.’ Pickering eyed her.\n",
      "‘I suggest you are neither.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel nodded.\n",
      "Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) – microbots – were the newest tool in high-tech surveillance – ‘fly on the wall technology,’ they called it.\n",
      "Discovery magazine had run a cover story in May 1997 on microbots, featuring both ‘flying’ and ‘swimming’ models.\n",
      "‘I still can’t believe it,’ one scientist was saying.\n",
      "‘In your lifetime .\n",
      ". . did you ever think you would witness anything like this?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never,’ the scientist replied, beaming.\n",
      "‘It’s all a magnificent dream.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Delta-One had heard enough.\n",
      "‘Hey!’ she yelled to the pilot.\n",
      "‘What are you doing?’ Her voice was barely audible over the rotors.\n",
      "‘You’re supposed to be taking me to the White House!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot shook his head.\n",
      "‘Sorry, ma’am.\n",
      "‘So where is the President?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your meeting with him is elsewhere.’\n",
      "\n",
      "No shit.\n",
      "‘Where elsewhere?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not far now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s not what I asked.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sixteen more miles.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel scowled at him.\n",
      "‘Do you dodge bullets as well as you dodge questions?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot did not answer.\n",
      "‘You will be meeting the President in his office.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel turned, wondering if the guy was joking.\n",
      "‘The President of the United States has an office on Wallops Island?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot looked dead serious.\n",
      "‘The President of the United States has an office wherever he likes, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed toward the end of the runway.\n",
      "‘I’m meeting him aboard the . . .’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am.\n",
      "‘Looks like you’re in the new one this morning,’ the pilot said, motioning to the numbers on the plane’s tail fin.\n",
      "As the PaveHawk settled onto the runway beside the President’s plane, Rachel now understood the references to Air Force One being the commander-in-chief’s ‘portable home court advantage.’ The machine was an intimidating sight.\n",
      "The six-foot-high letters along the fuselage trumpeted ‘UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.’ A female English cabinet member had once accused President Nixon of ‘waving his manhood in her face’ when he asked her to join him aboard Air Force One.\n",
      "Later the crew jokingly nicknamed the plane ‘Big Dick.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ms Sexton?’ A blazer-clad Secret Serviceman materialized outside the chopper and opened the door for her.\n",
      "‘The President is waiting for you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel got out of the chopper and gazed up the steep gangway at the bulging hull.\n",
      "She had once heard the flying ‘Oval Office’ had over four thousand square feet of interior floor space, including four separate private sleeping quarters, berths for a twenty-six-member flight crew, and two galleys capable of providing food for fifty people.\n",
      "‘Wait here,’ the serviceman said, and he disappeared.\n",
      "Supposedly, Boeing designers had carefully laid out this fore cabin to provide passengers with ‘a sense of order mixed with tranquility.’ Tranquility, however, was the last thing Rachel Sexton was feeling at the moment.\n",
      "‘Stealing souvenirs already?’ a deep voice asked behind her.\n",
      "‘I’m not royalty, Ms Sexton.\n",
      "Gabrielle Ashe was black, but her tawny coloring was more of a deep cinnamon or mahogany, the kind of comfortable in-between that Sexton knew bleeding heart ‘whites’ could endorse without feeling like they were giving away the farm.\n",
      "After promoting Gabrielle, Sexton had invited her to a late night ‘orientation session’ in his private office.\n",
      "‘.\n",
      "‘You aren’t listening,’ she said.\n",
      "‘Certainly am.’ He grinned.\n",
      "‘Forget about this CNN debate.\n",
      "‘Fine.\n",

      "‘Okay, I’ll turn it down a notch.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good.\n",
      "Just keep it in play.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Any news from the White House?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabrielle looked pleasantly baffled.\n",
      "‘Continued silence.\n",
      "‘I hear the White House campaign staff is as confused as we are.\n",
      "The President is offering no explanation for his vanishing act, and everyone over there is furious.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Any theories?’ Sexton asked.\n",
      "‘As it turns out, I got some interesting data this morning from a contact of mine in the White House.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton recognized the look in her eyes.\n",
      "‘Rumor has it,’ his assistant said, lowering her voice, ‘the President’s strange behavior all started last week after an emergency private briefing with the administrator of NASA.\n",
      "‘You think maybe NASA delivered some more bad news?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Seems a logical explanation,’ she said hopefully.\n",
      "‘Although it would have to be pretty critical to make the President drop everything.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton considered it.\n",
      "‘NASA is costing Americans a fortune,’ Gabrielle wrote, including a list of financial figures, failures, and bailouts.\n",
      "‘Voters have no idea.\n",
      "‘Yeah, and while I’m at it, I’ll rail against singing the national anthem at baseball games.’\n",
      "\n",
      "In the weeks that followed, Gabrielle continued to send information about NASA across the senator’s desk.\n",
      "‘Money for education?’ he said.\n",
      "‘Well, maybe I’ll cut the space program in half.\n",
      "‘Fifteen billion a year?’ the first caller said, sounding shocked.\n",
      "‘With a B?\n",
      "Are you telling me that my son’s math class is overcrowded because schools can’t afford enough teachers, and NASA is spending fifteen billion dollars a year taking pictures of space dust?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Um .\n",
      "‘Absurd!\n",
      "Does the President have the power to do something about that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Absolutely,’ Sexton replied, gaining confidence.\n",
      "‘A President can veto the budget request of any agency he or she deems overfunded.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then you have my vote, Senator Sexton.\n",
      "‘Senator, I just read that NASA’s International Space Station is way overbudget and the President is thinking of giving NASA emergency funding to keep the project going.\n",
      "‘True!’ He explained that the space station was originally proposed as a joint venture, with twelve countries sharing the costs.\n",
      "‘Our cost for the ISS project,’ Sexton announced, ‘has risen from the proposed eight billion to a staggering one hundred billion dollars!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The caller sounded furious.\n",
      "‘Why the hell doesn’t the President pull the plug?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton could have kissed the guy.\n",
      "‘Damn good question.\n",
      "When the show was over, with the exception of a few NASA diehards calling in with poignant overtures about man’s eternal quest for knowledge, the consensus was in: Sexton’s campaign had stumbled onto the holy grail of campaigning – a new ‘hot button’ – a yet untapped controversial issue that struck a nerve with voters.\n",
      "‘So glad you could make it,’ President Herney said, reaching out to shake Rachel’s hand.\n",
      "‘Of .\n",
      "‘If you follow me,’ he said in a cheery voice, ‘I’ve got a cup of coffee with your name on it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The President pressed the intercom and called for some coffee in his office.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Not at all.\n",
      "‘It’s very .\n",

      "‘Ms Sexton, that was a joke.\n",
      "‘Traveling alone, Mr President?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "‘Just landed, actually.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel was surprised.\n",
      "‘My staff deplaned right before you arrived,’ the President said.\n",
      "‘I’m headed back to the White House shortly to meet them, but I wanted to meet you here instead of my office.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Trying to intimidate me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘On the contrary.\n",
      "The White House is anything but private, and news of a meeting between the two of us would put you in an awkward position with your father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I appreciate that, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It seems you’re managing a delicate balancing act quite gracefully, and I see no reason to disrupt that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel flashed on her breakfast meeting with her father and doubted that it qualified as ‘graceful.’ Nonetheless, Zach Herney was going out of his way to be decent, and he certainly didn’t have to.\n",
      "‘May I call you Rachel?’ Herney asked.\n",
      "‘Of course.’ May I call you Zach?\n",
      "‘My office,’ the President said, ushering her through a carved maple door.\n",
      "‘Well, Rachel,’ Herney said, sighing tiredly as he settled into his chair.\n",
      "‘I imagine you’ve got to be pretty damned confused to be sitting here right now, am I right?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever was left of Rachel’s guard crumbled away with the candor in the man’s voice.\n",
      "‘Actually, sir, I’m baffled.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Herney laughed out loud.\n",
      "‘Terrific.\n",
      "It’s not every day I can baffle someone from the NRO.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s not every day someone from the NRO is invited aboard Air Force One by a President in hiking boots.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The President laughed again.\n",
      "‘Cream and sugar?’ the President asked, standing up to pour.\n",
      "‘Cream, please.’ Rachel savored the rich aroma.\n",
      "‘Authentic Paul Revere,’ he said.\n",
      "‘One of the little luxuries.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel sipped the coffee.\n",
      "‘Anyhow,’ the President said, pouring himself a cup and sitting back down, ‘I’ve got limited time here, so let’s get to business.’ The President plopped a sugar cube in his coffee and gazed up at her.\n",
      "‘I imagine Bill Pickering warned you that the only reason I would want to see you would be to use you to my political advantage?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Actually, sir, that’s exactly what he said.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The President chuckled.\n",
      "‘Always the cynic.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So he’s wrong?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you kidding?’ the President laughed.\n",
      "‘Bill Pickering is never wrong.\n",
      "‘Gabrielle Ashe,’ the senator said, reading her name tag.\n",
      "‘A lovely name for a lovely young woman.’ His eyes were reassuring.\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir,’ Gabrielle replied, feeling the man’s strength as she shook his hand.\n",
      "‘I was really impressed by your message.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Glad to hear it!’ Sexton thrust a business card into her hand.\n",
      "‘I’m always looking for bright young minds who share my vision.\n",
      "‘You okay?’ Sexton was watching her now.\n",
      "‘Fine.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You aren’t still thinking about that drudge, are you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She shrugged.\n",
      "‘I’m still a little worried, yeah.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Forget it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What I am about to tell you, Rachel,’ the President said, ‘is classified “UMBRA.” Well beyond your current security clearance.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel felt the walls of Air Force One closing in around her.\n",
      "‘Two weeks ago,’ the President said, locking eyes with her, ‘NASA made a discovery.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The words hung a moment in the air before Rachel could process them.\n",
      "Of course, these days a ‘NASA discovery’ usually meant realizing they’d grossly underbudgeted some new project.\n",
      "‘Before we talk further,’ the President said, ‘I’d like to know if you share your father’s cynicism over space exploration.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel resented the comment.\n",
      "‘I certainly hope you didn’t call me here to ask me to control my father’s rants against NASA.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed.\n",
      "‘Hell, no.\n",
      "I’ve been around the Senate long enough to know that nobody controls Sedgewick Sexton.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My father is an opportunist, sir.\n",
      "‘I will admit,’ the President continued, ‘NASA has been a walking disaster area lately.\n",
      "‘And yet, sir, didn’t I just read that you bailed them out last week with another three million in emergency funding to keep them solvent?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The President chuckled.\n",
      "‘Your father was pleased with that one, wasn’t he?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing like sending ammunition to your executioner.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you hear him on Nightline?\n",
      "“Zach Herney is a space addict, and the taxpayers are funding his habit.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But you keep proving him right, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Herney nodded.\n",
      "‘I make it no secret that I’m an enormous fan of NASA.\n",
      "‘Today,’ Herney said, his voice intensifying, ‘I intend to change your entire opinion of NASA.’\n",

      "Rachel eyed him with uncertainty.\n",
      "‘You have my vote already, sir.\n",
      "You may want to concentrate on the rest of the country.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I intend to.’ He took a sip of coffee and smiled.\n",
      "‘And I’m going to ask you to help me.’ Pausing, he leaned toward her.\n",
      "‘In a most unusual way.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel could now feel Zach Herney scrutinizing her every move, like a hunter trying to gauge if his prey intended to run or fight.\n",
      "‘I assume,’ the President said, pouring them both more coffee, ‘that you’re aware of a NASA project called EOS?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel nodded.\n",
      "‘Earth Observation System.\n",
      "‘As surprising as this may sound, the NASA discovery I’m referring to was made by EOS.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Rachel felt lost.\n",
      "‘I’ve heard nothing,’ Rachel said, ‘about any EOS discovery.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I know.\n",
      "‘In my experience, sir, when it comes to NASA, no news is generally bad news.’ Restraint was not a forte of the NASA public relations department.\n",
      "‘Ah, yes.\n",
      "Is he still moaning and groaning about NASA’s loose lips?’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘He damn well better.\n",

      "‘You have a skeptical look on your face,’ the President said, eying her askance.\n",
      "‘Well . . .’ She hesitated.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rachel looked at the three samples.\n",
      "‘All meteorites,’ Corky said, ‘consist of varying amounts of nickel-iron alloys, silicates, and sulfides.\n",
      "We classify them on the basis of their metal-to-silicate ratios.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel already had the feeling Corky Marlinson’s meteorite ‘primer’ was going to be more than thirty seconds.\n",
      "‘This first sample here,’ Corky said, pointing to a shiny, jet-black stone, ‘is an iron-core meteorite.\n",
      "‘That charred outer layer is called a fusion crust,’ Corky said.\n",
      "‘It’s the result of extreme heating as the meteor falls through our atmosphere.\n",
      "‘This next one is what we call a stony-iron meteorite.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel studied the sample, noting that it too was charred on the outside.\n",
      "‘Pretty,’ Rachel said.\n",
      "‘Are you kidding, it’s gorgeous!’ Corky talked for a minute about the high olivine content causing the green luster, and then he reached dramatically for the third and final sample, handing it to Rachel.\n",
      "‘This,’ Corky said with finality, ‘is called a stony meteorite.\n",
      "‘The meteorite buried in the ice here at Milne is a stony meteorite – a lot like the one in your hand.\n",
      "‘This one looks like a rock someone left in a fireplace and burned.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘One hell of a fireplace!\n",
      "‘This is the good part.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Picture this,’ Corky said, taking the meteorite sample from Rachel.\n",
      "‘Let’s imagine this little fella is the size of a house.’ He held the sample high over his head.\n",
      "‘Okay .\n",
      "‘Our meteorite is moving toward earth .\n",
      "‘Now it’s moving fast,’ Corky exclaimed.\n",
      "‘Over ten miles per second – thirty-six thousand miles per hour!\n",
      "‘Falling below one hundred kilometers, it’s starting to glow!\n",
      "‘Now it’s falling past the eighty-kilometer mark, and the exterior becomes heated to over eighteen hundred degrees Celsius!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel watched in disbelief as the presidential award-winning astrophysicist shook the meteorite more fiercely, sputtering out juvenile sound effects.\n",
      "‘Sixty kilometers!’ Corky was shouting now.\n",
      "‘Our meteoroid encounters the atmospheric wall.\n",
      "‘Instantly, the meteorite cools and stops glowing.\n",
      "‘Now,’ Corky said, ‘our huge meteorite is skipping across our lower atmosphere . . .’ On his knees, he arched the meteorite toward the ground on a shallow slant.\n",
      "‘It’s headed toward the Arctic Ocean .\n",
      "‘BAM!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel jumped.\n",
      "‘The impact is cataclysmic!\n",
      "‘One piece keeps skimming, tumbling toward Ellesmere Island . . .’ He brought it right up to her toe.\n",
      "‘It skips off the ocean, bouncing up onto land . . .’ He moved it up and over the tongue of her shoe and rolled it to a stop on top of her foot near her ankle.\n",
      "‘And finally comes to rest high on the Milne Glacier, where snow and ice quickly cover it, protecting it from atmospheric erosion.’ Corky stood up with a smile.\n",
      "‘Well, Dr Marlinson, that explanation was exceptionally . . .’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lucid?’ Corky offered.\n",
      "‘In a word.’\n",

      "‘Look at the cross section.’\n",

      "‘Tilt it into the light,’ Tolland prompted, his voice warm and kind.\n",
      "‘And look closely.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel brought the rock close to her eyes and tilted it against the dazzling halogens reflecting overhead.\n",
      "‘Those little bubbles are called “chondrules,”’ Corky said.\n",
      "‘And they occur only in meteorites.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel squinted at the droplets.\n",
      "‘Granted, I’ve never seen anything like this in an earth rock.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nor will you!’ Corky declared.\n",
      "‘Chondrules are one geologic structure we simply do not have on earth.\n",
      "The chondrules in that meteorite date only about one hundred and ninety million years old.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One hundred ninety million years is young?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Heck, yes!\n",
      "The point here, though, is that this sample contains chondrules – conclusive meteoric evidence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Okay,’ Rachel said.\n",
      "‘Chondrules are conclusive.\n",
      "Got it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And finally,’ Corky said, heaving a sigh, ‘if the fusion crust and chondrules don’t convince you, we astronomers have a foolproof method to confirm meteoric origin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Being?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Corky gave a casual shrug.\n",
      "‘We simply use a petrographic polarizing microscope, an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a neutron activation analyzer, or an induction-coupled plasma spectrometer to measure ferromagnetic ratios.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolland groaned.\n",
      "‘Now he’s showing off.\n",
      "What Corky means is that we can prove a rock is a meteorite simply by measuring its chemical content.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hey, ocean boy!’ Corky chided.\n",
      "‘Let’s leave the science to the scientists, shall we?’ He immediately turned back to Rachel.\n",
      "‘In earth rocks, the mineral nickel occurs in either extremely high percentages or extremely low; nothing in the middle.\n",
      "‘Okay, gentlemen, fusion crusts, chondrules, midrange nickel contents, all of which prove it’s from space.\n",
      "‘But why am I here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Corky heaved a portentous sigh.\n",
      "‘You want to see a sample of the meteorite NASA found in the ice underneath us?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I die here, please.\n",
      "‘This is a slice of a core sample that we drilled yesterday.’ Corky handed the disk to Rachel.\n",
      "‘I see the fusion crust,’ she said.\n",
      "‘Yeah, this sample was taken from near the outside of the meteorite, so it still has some crust on it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel tilted the disk in the light and spotted the tiny metallic globules.\n",
      "‘And I see the chondrules.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good,’ Corky said, his voice tense with excitement.\n",
      "‘And I can tell you from having run this thing through a petrographic polarizing microscope that its nickel content is midrange – nothing like a terrestrial rock.\n",
      "‘Dr Marlinson, it’s a meteorite.\n",
      "Tolland put a hand on Rachel’s shoulder and whispered, ‘Flip it over.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel turned the disk over so she could see the other side.\n",
      "she gasped, and yet as she stared at the rock she realized her definition of ‘impossible’ had just changed forever.\n",
      "‘It’s . . .’ Rachel stammered, almost unable to speak theword.\n",
      "‘It’s .\n",
      "‘Welcome aboard,’ Corky said.\n",
      "‘An insect from space . . .’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Insects have three pairs of legs, not seven.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel did not even hear him.\n",
      "‘You can clearly see,’ Corky said, ‘that the dorsal shell is segmented in plates like a terrestrial pill bug, and yet the two prominent tail-like appendages differentiate it as something closer to a louse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel’s mind had already tuned Corky out.\n",
      "‘Speaking of NASA,’ Sexton segued casually.\n",

      "‘I’m afraid not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton gloated.\n",
      "In the world of media sound bites, ‘no comment’ translated loosely to ‘guilty as charged.’\n",

      "‘And how about the rumors of a secret, emergency meeting between the President and the administrator of NASA?’\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Tench looked surprised.\n",
      "‘I’m not sure what meeting you’re referring to.\n",
      "The President takes many meetings.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, he does.’ Sexton decided to go straight at her.\n",
      "‘Ms Tench, you are a great supporter of the space agency, is that right?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tench sighed, sounding tired of Sexton’s pet issue.\n",
      "‘I believe in the importance of preserving America’s technological edge – be that military, industry, intelligence, telecommunications.\n",
      "‘I’m curious, ma’am, is it your influence behind the President’s continued support of this obviously ailing agency?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tench shook her head.\n",
      "‘No.\n",
      "‘Senator,’ Tench argued, ‘you want to cut NASA’s budget, but do you have any idea how many high-tech jobs will be lost?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton almost laughed in the woman’s face.\n",
      "‘We’re talking about billions in savings here, Marjorie, and if the result is that a bunch of NASA scientists have to get in their BMWs and take their marketable skills elsewhere, then so be it.\n",
      "The CNN host prompted, ‘Ms Tench?\n",
      "‘I guess I’m just surprised to hear that Mr Sexton is willing to establish himself as so staunchly anti-NASA.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton’s eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nice try, lady.‘Iamnot anti-NASA, and I resent the accusation.\n",
      "They said they could build the space station for eight billion; now it’s one hundred billion.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘May I ask you a direct question, Senator?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton did not respond.\n",
      "‘Senator, if I told you that we could not explore space for less than NASA is currently spending, would you act to abolish the space agency altogether?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The question felt like a boulder landing in Sexton’s lap.\n",
      "She had just blindsided Sexton with a ‘fence-buster’ – a carefully crafted yes/no question designed to force a fence-straddling opponent to choose clear sides and clarify his position once and for all.\n",
      "‘I have no doubt that with proper management NASA can explore space for a lot less than we are currently—’\n",

      "Although NASA had tried to give the project a facelift by renaming it ‘Origins’ and shuffling some of its objectives, it was still the same losing gamble.\n",

      "Oddly, Tench looked almost eager to hear this.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I’m saying that if any other government agency had spent forty-five million over thirty-five years and had not produced one single result, they would have been axed a long time ago.’ Sexton paused to let the gravity of the statement settle in.\n",
      "‘After thirty-five years, I think it’s pretty obvious we’re not going to find extraterrestrial life.’\n",

      "\n",
      "Panspermia, Rachel thought, still barely able to grasp the implications.\n",
      "‘So, not only does this fossil confirm that life exists elsewhere in the universe, but it practically proves panspermia .\n",

      "‘Thanks.\n",
      "Sadly, only weeks after NASA’s triumphant press conference, several civilian scientists stepped forward with proof that the rock’s ‘signs of life’ were really nothing more than kerogen produced by terrestrial contamination.\n",
      "In that same edition, paleobiologist Stephen Jay Gould summed up the problems with ALH84001 by pointing out that the evidence in it was chemical and inferential, rather than ‘solid,’ like an unambiguous bone or shell.\n",

      "‘Very nice.’ He looked at Rachel.\n",
      "‘What Corky’s trying to say is that because there’s so much scientific data to convey, the President thought a short visual documentary about the meteorite might help make the information more accessible to mainstream America, many of whom, oddly, don’t have advanced degrees in astrophysics.’\n",

      "The meteor became known as the Jungersol Fall, after the name of the exploration’s leader.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So,’ Corky added, ‘the fact that the core dates and the historic record match is virtual proof that we’re looking at a fragment of the same meteorite that Jungersol recorded seeing in 1716.’\n",

      "‘Granted the species I featured on the show was not the bioluminescent species we saw here, but maybe the same thing happened.’\n",

      "‘Frozen plankton,’ Rachel continued, excited to have Michael Tolland so enthusiastic about her idea, ‘could explain everything we’re seeing here.\n",

      "From Norah’s tone, there was obviously some sort of ‘but’ – and yet it seemed she had just confirmed Rachel’s theory.\n",
      "‘So,’ Tolland ventured, ‘you’re saying it’s possible, right?\n",

      "‘My company hopes to stay in business long enough to launch the country’s first tourist-shuttle prototype next May.\n",

      "‘You could give this to any petrologist or geologist or astronomer on earth, they would run tests, and they would tell you two things: one, it is one hundred and ninety million years old; and two, it is chemically dissimilar from the kind of rock we have here on earth.’\n",

      "Why?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I heard my Jourdain in the background when I called you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabrielle cringed inwardly.\n",
      "‘Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I spend all day in that office.\n",
      "‘Let me get this straight, Senator.\n",
      "‘Just for the record, are you accusing me of disarming a federal alarm system, picking two sets of locks, breaking into your office, being stupid enough to answer my cellphone while in the process of committing a felony, rearming the alarm system on my way out, and then calmly using the ladies’ room before I run off with nothing to show for it?\n",
      "‘There’s a reason people shouldn’t drink alone,’ Gabrielle said.\n",
      "‘Now do you want to talk about NASA, or not?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton felt befuddled as he walked back into his office.\n",
      "‘Drink, Gabrielle?’ he asked, turning back into the room.\n",
      "‘Oh, for God’s sake!\n",
      "Tell me what you found out at NASA.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think I’ve had enough for tonight,’ she said, sounding distant.\n",
      "‘Let’s talk tomorrow.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton was in no mood for games.\n",
      "‘I screwed up,’ he said.\n",
      "‘I’m sorry.\n",
      "‘Have a seat.\n",
      "‘I think I saw a fax in the machine,’ Sexton called over his shoulder as he entered the bathroom.\n",
      "‘Have a look at it for me, will you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton closed the door and filled the sink with cold water.\n",

      "‘What?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The meteorite . . .’ she choked, her voice frail as her trembling hand held the stack of fax papers out to him.\n",
      "‘And your daughter .\n",
      "The first page was a computerized image whose heading read ‘Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).’ The picture appeared to be an ice-sounding of some sort.\n",
      "‘Rachel is in danger,’ Gabrielle said.\n",
      "‘Her note says NASA and the White House are trying to—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton’s fax machine suddenly began ringing again.\n",
      "‘Hello,’ Sexton’s outbound message crackled.\n",
      "‘This is the office of Senator Sedgewick Sexton.\n",
      "‘Senator Sexton?’ The man’s voice had a lucid rawness to it.\n",
      "‘This is William Pickering, director of the National Reconnaissance Office.\n",
      "‘But that’s the director of—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Senator,’ Pickering continued, sounding almost relieved that no one had picked up.\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I am calling with some very troubling news.\n",
      "‘With luck, Senator, all of this will be resolved by the time you wake up.\n",
      "‘Rachel is a hostage?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton sensed that even in her disillusionment with him, Gabrielle felt a pained empathy to think of a bright young woman in danger.\n",
      "‘What are you doing?’ Gabrielle demanded, sounding bewildered.\n",
      "‘They won’t kill Rachel,’ Sexton declared.\n",
      "‘Who are those copies for?’ Gabrielle demanded.\n",
      "‘William Pickering said not to tell anyone!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton turned from the machine and looked at Gabrielle, amazed by how unattractive he suddenly found her.\n",
      "‘Go home, Gabrielle.\n",
      "Rachel was always amazed at what could be accomplished ‘in the name of national security.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course if that fails, Rachel thought, Pickering could just fly by and send a Hellfire missile through the window and blow up the fax machine.\n",
      "‘You’re a survivor,’ her voice whispered.\n",
      "‘Promise me you’ll find another love.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll never want another,’ Tolland had told her.\n",
      "‘You’ll have to learn.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on the deck of the Goya, Tolland realized, he was learning.\n",
      "‘Sometimes,’ he said, ‘circumstances raise impossible decisions.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel’s eyes were unyielding.\n",
      "‘You created these circumstances.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘War involves casualties,’ Pickering said, his voice firmer now.\n",
      "‘You of all people should understand that, Rachel.’ His eyes focused in on her.\n",
      "‘Iactura paucourm serva multos.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He could see she recognized the words – almost a cliché in national security circles.\n",
      "‘And now Michael and I have become part of your few?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Pickering considered it.\n",
      "‘Release your partner and end this.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Delta-One nodded.\n",
      "And to ensure he did not try anything tricky, Delta-One would take out insurance known in his business as ‘biological collateral.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Use your adversaries against one another.\n",
      "‘Ms Sexton, stand up,’ Delta-One said.\n",
      "‘Climb up and stand on top of the sub.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel looked frightened and confused.\n",
      "‘Just do it,’ Delta-One said.\n",
      "‘Get on top of the sub,’ the soldier said, returning to Tolland and pushing the gun against his head.\n",
      "‘Okay, let’s move,’ the soldier said to Tolland.\n",
      "‘Go to the controls and close the trapdoor.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At gunpoint, Tolland began moving toward the control panel with the soldier behind him.\n",
      "His lips mouthed, ‘Jump in!\n",
      "When Rachel saw the soldier with the machine gun stabilizing himself nearby, she called out inside the sub, ‘Mike, look out!’\n",
      "\n",
      "But Delta-One ignored Tolland entirely.\n",
      "126\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t do this,’ Gabrielle begged the senator as he finished at the copy machine.\n",
      "‘You’re risking your daughter’s life!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton blocked out her voice, moving back to his desk now with ten identical stacks of photocopies.\n",
      "‘Don’t you see you’ve already won?’ Gabrielle demanded.\n",
      "‘There’s no way Zach Herney and NASA will survive this scandal.\n",
      "‘Don’t do this,’ she said, ‘or I’ll go public about our affair.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Really?\n",
      "I’ll simply deny it again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The White House has photos,’ Gabrielle declared.\n",
      "‘They don’t have photos.\n",
      "‘I have immunity.\n",
      "‘You’re making a mistake.\n",
      "‘I made you, Gabrielle, and now I’ve unmade you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That fax from Rachel will give you the presidency.\n",
      "You owe her.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Then she’ll cement my sympathy vote.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘I’m calling the White—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton spun and slapped her hard across the face.\n",
      "‘If you so much as think of crossing me on this, I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.’ He stood unflinching, clutching the stack of sealed envelopes under his arm.\n",
      "‘Rachel!\n",
      "‘Rachel!’ The voice was muffled.\n",
      "‘Michael!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolland surfaced, exhaling in relief to see Rachel moving inside the sub.\n",
      "‘Now or never,’ he gasped as he grabbed the hatch wheel and heaved it counterclockwise.\n",
      "‘I tried!’ she shouted.\n",
      "‘I couldn’t turn it!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The water was lapping across the portal lid now.\n",
      "‘Turn together!’ he shouted to her.\n",
      "‘You’re clockwise in there!’ He knew the dial was clearly marked.\n",
      "‘Okay, now!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolland braced himself against the ballast air tanks and strained with all his energy.\n",
      "The lower openings, called ‘flooding holes,’ always remained open, while the holes on top, ‘vent valves,’ could be opened and closed to let air escape so water would flood in.\n",
      "The Brits called this tank ‘the down express.’ The Germans called it ‘putting on lead shoes.’ Either way, the meaning was clear.\n",
      "‘Rachel .\n",
      "‘Fight, Rachel!’ her mother was shouting, reaching down to pull her out of the water.\n",
      "‘Grab on!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel closed her eyes.\n",
      "‘Kick, Rachel!\n",
      "‘Yes!’ her mother shouted.\n",
      "‘Help me lift you!\n",
      "He felt intoxicated as he approached the podium, pleased to see his improvised stage included two ‘fame-frames’ – large, free-standing partitions that flanked his podium like navy-blue curtains – an old Ronald Reagan trick to ensure he stood out against any backdrop.\n",
      "‘Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,’ Sexton said, laying the envelopes on the lectern before him.\n",
      "‘I will make this as short and painless as possible.\n",
      "‘And yet, I am a man who believes in the truth.\n",
      "‘My friends,’ Sexton said, letting his eyes connect with the crowd.\n",
      "‘I have weighed this heavily.\n",
      "‘The truth is the truth.\n",
      "‘I do not take pleasure in doing this,’ Sexton continued, sensing his timing was perfect.\n",
      "‘But I feel it is my duty to let the American people know they have been lied to.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The aircraft thundered in, touching down on the esplanade to their right.\n",
      "‘If you could give me just one minute?\n",
      "‘Family first.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A few of the reporters laughed.\n",
      "‘Honey?’ he said, smiling and opening his arms as Rachel came toward him.\n",
      "‘What a surprise!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel walked up and slapped his face.\n",
      "‘You should not be here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel saw wrath in his eyes and for the first time in her life felt unafraid.\n",
      "‘I turned to you for help, and you sold me out!\n",
      "I was almost killed!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’re obviously fine.’ His tone was almost disappointed.\n",

      "‘What you’re about to do is madness.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh?’ Sexton chuckled.\n",
      "‘Those envelopes contain information you sent me, Rachel.\n",
      "The President’s blood is on your hands.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I faxed you that information when I needed your help!\n",

      "\n",
      "‘But they are not!\n",
      "‘So naïve.\n",

      "‘At what cost?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be so self-righteous.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You know how this will look.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He shrugged.\n",
      "‘Maybe NASA’s time has come.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Sexton sensed the press was getting restless beyond the partition, and he had no intention of standing here all morning and being lectured by his daughter.\n",
      "‘We’re through here,’ he said.\n",
      "‘I have a press conference to give.’\n",
      "\n",

      "There’s a better way.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not for me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A howl of feedback echoed out of the PA system behind him, and Sexton wheeled to see a late-arriving female reporter, huddled over his podium, attempting to attach a network microphone to one of the gooseneck clips.\n",
      "Sexton couldn’t see her face, but she was obviously ‘network’ – wearing a full-length cashmere coat, matching scarf, and low-slung mohair beret with an ABC press pass clipped to it.\n",
      "‘I’ll take those,’ he snapped, holding out his hand for the envelopes.\n",
      "‘Sorry . . .’ she muttered, obviously embarrassed.\n",
      "‘I guess I’d better hand these out before someone gets hurt!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd laughed, looking eager.\n",
      "‘Don’t do this,’ Rachel said to him.\n",
      "‘You’ll regret it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton ignored her.\n",
      "‘I’m asking you to trust me,’ Rachel said, her voice growing louder.\n",
      "‘It’s a mistake.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton picked up his envelopes, straightening the edges.\n",
      "‘Dad,’ Rachel said, intense and pleading now.\n",
      "‘This is your last chance to do what’s right.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Do what’s right?\n",
      "‘You’re just like your mother – idealistic and small.\n",
      "‘Sir?’ one reporter stammered, sounding stunned as he looked in his envelope.\n",
      "‘Is this for real?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton gave a somber sigh.\n",
      "‘Yes, I’m afraid it’s very real indeed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Murmurs of confusion now spread through the crowd.\n",
      "‘I’ll give everyone a moment to look through these pages,’ Sexton said, ‘and then I’ll take questions and attempt to shed some light on what you’re looking at.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Senator?’ another reporter asked, sounding utterly bewildered.\n",
      "‘Are these images authentic? .\n",
      ". . Unretouched?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One hundred percent,’ Sexton said, speaking more firmly now.\n",
      "‘I would not present the evidence to you otherwise.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The confusion in the crowd seemed to deepen, and Sexton thought he even heard some laughter – not at all the reaction he had expected.\n",
      "‘Um, Senator?’ someone said, sounding oddly amused.\n",
      "‘For the record, you stand behind the authenticity of these images?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton was getting frustrated.\n",
      "‘My friends, I will say this one last time, the evidence in your hands is one-hundred-percent accurate.\n",
      "‘You’re right, Senator.\n",
      "‘So I guess we’re puzzled as to why you’ve decided to share it with us like this, especially after denying it so vehemently earlier.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexton had no idea what the man was talking about.\n",
      "‘We tried to stop you,’ she said.\n",
      "‘We gave you every chance.’ A woman stood beside her.\n",
      "‘I hear you’re leaving us,’ Herney said, sounding disappointed.\n",
      "‘The choice you made this morning, Gabrielle . . .’ He paused, as if at a loss for words.\n",
      "‘I did it for me, too,’ Gabrielle finally said.\n",
      "‘I owe you my thanks all the same.’ He stood, motioning for her to follow him into the hall.\n",
      "‘I was actually hoping you’d stick around long enough that I could offer you a post on my budgeting staff.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabrielle gave him a dubious look.\n",
      "‘Stop spending and start mending?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He chuckled.\n",
      "‘Something like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think we both know, sir, that I’m more of a liability to you at the moment than an asset.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Give it a few months.\n",
      "‘A few of them were even U.S. presidents.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabrielle knew he was right.\n",
      "‘What are you going to tell them?’ Gabrielle asked.\n",
      "‘Over the years, I’ve learned one thing over and over . . .’ He put a hand on her shoulder and smiled.\n",
      "‘There’s just no substitute for the truth.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabrielle was filled with an unexpected pride as she watched him stride toward the stage.\n",
      "‘Sadly,’ one political analyst on TV was saying, ‘it seems NASA has discovered no signs of life from space after all.\n",
      "This time, however, a number of highly respected civilians were also among those fooled.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Normally,’ a second analyst chimed in, ‘I would have to say that a deception of the magnitude the President described this evening would be devastating for his career .\n",

      "The agent led Rachel down the impeccably appointed hallway to a plain-looking doorway nearby.\n",

      "‘.\n",
      "Corky dropped his crutches on the spot and put an arm around the woman’s shoulders for support, and said, ‘To the kitchen, love!’\n",
